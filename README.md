## ✅ Frontend Developer Questions (Explained for Top Tech Interviews)

### 1. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

**Interview Style Answer:**
In JavaScript, `==` performs **type coercion**, so it compares values **after converting them to a common type**. This can introduce bugs in large codebases. In contrast, `===` checks for **strict equality** — meaning both value and type must match.

**Example:**

```js
0 == "0"     // true
0 === "0"    // false
```

**Follow-Up Tip:** In interviews, mention that you prefer `===` for safer, predictable comparisons.

### 2. **Explain Event Delegation. Why is it important in SPAs?**

**Answer:**
Event delegation is a technique where instead of attaching individual event listeners to child elements, we **attach a single listener to a parent** and use `event.target` to handle events conditionally.

This improves:

* **Memory efficiency** (fewer listeners)
* **Performance** (less work in the event loop)
* **Scalability** (works with dynamic content)

**Example:**

```js
document.getElementById("list").addEventListener("click", e => {
  if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log("Clicked: ", e.target.innerText);
  }
});
```

**Google Follow-up:** “How would this scale in a React environment?”
→ React abstracts this using synthetic events and a centralized event listener at the document level.

### 3. **let vs const vs var — what would you use in production code?**

**Answer:**

| Keyword | Scope    | Mutable | Re-declarable | Hoisted           |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| var     | function | ✅ yes   | ✅ yes         | ✅ yes (undefined) |
| let     | block    | ✅ yes   | ❌ no          | ✅ yes (TDZ)       |
| const   | block    | ❌ no    | ❌ no          | ✅ yes (TDZ)       |

**Production Best Practices:**

* Use `const` for all variables that don't change.
* Use `let` if the variable is reassigned.
* Avoid `var` entirely — it's error-prone and not block scoped.

### 4. **What is the CSS Box Model and how does it affect layout calculation?**

**Answer:**
The Box Model consists of:

1. **Content**: Text/images
2. **Padding**: Space inside border
3. **Border**: Edge of the element
4. **Margin**: Space outside element

In layout calculations, browser calculates:
`Total width = margin + border + padding + content`

**Google Tip:** Mention `box-sizing: border-box` — which changes width to include padding/border.

---

### 5. **How would you optimize a large, slow-loading web app?**

**Answer:**

* Bundle Optimization: Code splitting (React.lazy + Suspense)
* Caching: Service Workers, HTTP caching
* Lazy Loading: Images and components
* Minification: Compress JS, CSS
* CDN usage: Faster delivery
* Reduce re-renders: `React.memo`, `useMemo`
* Tree-shaking: Remove dead code

## ⚛️ React Developer Questions (High-Level Answers)

### 1. **Explain the Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm.**

**Answer:**
React creates a Virtual DOM (VDOM), which is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM.
When state/props change:

1. React creates a new VDOM
2. Diffs it against the previous VDOM
3. Finds minimal changes
4. Updates the real DOM efficiently

**Follow-Up:** React uses a reconciliation algorithm based on **heuristics**: it compares by keys and element type. Large lists need unique keys for efficient diffs.

---

### 2. **What are Hooks, and how do they replace lifecycle methods?**

**Answer:**
Hooks are functions that let you use React features (state, lifecycle, context) in function components.

| Class Lifecycle      | Hook Equivalent             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| componentDidMount    | useEffect(() => {}, \[])    |
| componentDidUpdate   | useEffect with deps         |
| componentWillUnmount | return cleanup in useEffect |

**Google Tip:** Custom hooks abstract logic → clean, reusable components.

---

### 3. **How does `useEffect` work internally?**

**Answer:**

* Runs **after DOM paint**.
* Tracks dependencies in an array.
* If deps changed → cleanup (if any) → re-run effect.

**Example:**

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => console.log("Tick"), 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer); // cleanup
}, []);
```

---

### 4. **What is Prop Drilling? How do you solve it at scale?**

**Answer:**
Prop Drilling is passing props through intermediate components that don't need them.

**Solutions:**

* Context API (lightweight, built-in)
* Redux / Zustand (when state becomes large/global)

---

### 5. **Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components – Which to prefer and why?**

**Answer:**
Controlled = React handles form state → predictable
Uncontrolled = DOM handles state → simpler for small cases

**Example:**

```js
<input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
```

**Prefer controlled in SPAs** — for form validation, state sync, and user feedback.

## 🧠 DSA Questions (Google-Style Logic & Code)

### 1. **Reverse a String**

```js
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

**Time:** O(n), **Space:** O(n)

---

### 2. **Check Palindrome**

```js
function isPalindrome(str) {
  let left = 0, right = str.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (str[left++] !== str[right--]) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

**Time:** O(n), **Space:** O(1)

---

### 3. **Find Maximum in Array**

```js
function findMax(arr) {
  return arr.reduce((max, curr) => curr > max ? curr : max, -Infinity);
}
```

---

### 4. **Fibonacci Series**

```js
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  let a = 0, b = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }
  return b;
}
```

**Time:** O(n), **Space:** O(1)

---

### 5. **Two Sum**

```js
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const diff = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(diff)) return [map.get(diff), i];
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
}
```

**Time:** O(n), **Space:** O(n)
